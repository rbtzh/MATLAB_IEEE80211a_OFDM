# IEEE 802.11a OFDM simulation implemented in MATLAB

This is a simulation of IEEE802.11a OFDM process, provides analyzation in constellation diagram.

Made by Zhao Yanbo as a coursework in XUPT. 2024.

## How to use this?

### as Script
run main.m in MATLAB
### as GUI App
run gui.mlapp in MATLAB

To use this app, you can set your desired paramaters in Control section, press Run button, and preserve the result calculated and presented in the Result section.

If the SNR is too weak to detect, a red lamp will indecate this situation, which locates in the down-left corner.

Dragging the SNR slider will be extremely performance consuming, please be aware of it.

## My Environment

Well, it runs on my computer*

*my computer:

- MATLAB R2023b Update 7
- Windows 11
- Lenovo XiaoXin Pro 16 with AMD 7840HS

but it shouldn't be pickey anyways.

Feel free to reach me via issues whenever you encount issues.
